# üåÅ Carbon Emissions Impact

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the relationship between carbon emissions (CO‚ÇÇ) and global temperature anomalies. Using time-series analysis, clustering techniques, and simulations, the study demonstrates how rising CO‚ÇÇ levels contribute to global warming.

## Key Findings

There is a strong positive correlation between increasing CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and rising global temperatures.

CO‚ÇÇ levels are increasing at a faster rate than temperature anomalies.

Time-series analysis reveals an escalating trend in emissions driving temperature increases.

Seasonal variations highlight the role of natural carbon sinks.

Lagged effects show that current CO‚ÇÇ levels have the most significant impact on temperature changes.

Simulations suggest that even small reductions in emissions could significantly mitigate global warming.

## Data Sources

Temperature Data: Contains global temperature anomalies across multiple years.

CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Data: Tracks carbon emissions across different periods.
